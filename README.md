Inventory Management System Database Management System Project using SQL

Please find attached the report file for my Inventory Management System Database Management System project implemented using Structured Query Language (SQL). The report includes an ER-Diagram to aid in understanding the system's structure.

Implementation Steps:

Download SQL Command Line and install it on your system.
Execute each "Create Table" command one by one (ensure that you remove any serial numbering, such as 1, 2, 3, before copying the command).
After creating the tables, use the provided commands in the PDF file to insert the necessary values into the tables.
Your Inventory Management System project is now ready to be used!
